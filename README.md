## Overview of Bike-sharing

The project involved using Tableau to visualize bike sharing data. The purpose of this project was to ascertain if the bike sharing business was a viable business to enter. In order to achieve this,  I created  powerful analytic dashboards that tells a story.  My friend, Kate was able to find a seed investor who was willing to invest in such a business. The first step involved how the bike business actually works in New York City after which I would develop a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. 

Once I was  done with the first phase of the project in the module, I had to go a step further to convince the investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to solidify this, a key stakeholder requested to see a bike trip analysis. I had to create visualizations to 

•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

 ### Summary of Bike-Sharing
The results show that: 

The length of time bikes were checked out the most was on Thursday by Males. It also shows that Males had the highest count of riders and subscribers users had the highest count.  

The two additional visualizations i would perform is Bike repairs and Bike Utilization.
